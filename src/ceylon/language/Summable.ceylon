"""Abstraction of types which support a binary addition
   operator `x + y`. For [[numeric types|Numeric]], this is
   just familiar numeric addition. For [[String]], it is
   string concatenation.
   
       Integer next = current + 1;
       String helloWorld = "hello" + " " + "world";
   
   A concrete class that implements this interface should be 
   a mathematical _semigroup_. That is, the addition 
   operation should be associative, satisfying:
   
   - `(x+y)+z == x+(y+z)`
   
   A `Summable` type might be a _monoid_, that is, a 
   semigroup with an additive identity element, usually 
   denoted `0`, but this is not required. For example:
   
   - `String` is a monoid with identity element `""`, 
   - `Float` is a monoid with identity element `0.0`, and 
   - `Integer` is a monoid with identity element `0`.
   
   For any monoid, the addition operation must satisfy:
   
   - `x + 0 == x`"""
