"Represents an iterable collection of elements of finite 
 size, with a well-defined notion of value equality. 
 `Collection` is the abstract supertype of [[List]], 
 [[Map]], and [[Set]].
 
 A `Collection` forms a [[Category]] of its elements, and 
 is [[Iterable]]. The elements of a collection are not
 necessarily distinct when compared using [[Object.equals]].
 
 A `Collection` may be [[cloned|clone]]. If a collection is
 immutable, it is acceptable that `clone()` produce a
 reference to the collection itself. If a collection is
 mutable, `clone()` should produce a collection containing 
 references to the same elements, with the same structure as 
 the original collection&mdash;that is, it should produce a 
 shallow copy of the collection.
 
 All `Collection`s are required to support a well-defined
 notion of [[value equality|Object.equals]], but the
 definition of equality depends upon the kind of collection.
 Equality for `Map`s and `Set`s has a quite different
 definition to equality for `List`s. Instances of two 
 different kinds of collection are never equal&mdash;for
 example, a `Map` is never equal to a `List`."
