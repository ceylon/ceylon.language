"""A string of characters. Each character in the string is a 
   [[32-bit Unicode character|Character]]. The internal 
   UTF-16 encoding is hidden from clients.
   
   A string is a [[Category]] of its [[characters]], and of 
   its substrings:
   
       'w' in greeting 
       "hello" in greeting
   
   Strings are [[summable|Summable]]:
   
       String greeting = "hello" + " " + "world";
   
   They are efficiently [[iterable|Iterable]]:
   
       for (char in "hello world") { ... }
   
   They are [[lists|List]] of [[characters|Character]]:
   
       value char = "hello world"[5];
   
   They are [[ranged|Ranged]]:
   
       String who = "hello world"[6...];
   
   Note that since `string[index]` evaluates to the optional 
   type `Character?`, it is often more convenient to write 
   `string[index..index]`, which evaluates to a `String` 
   containing a single character, or to the empty string 
   `""` if `index` refers to a position outside the string.
   
   It is easy to use comprehensions to transform strings:
   
       String { for (s in "hello world") if (s.letter) s.uppercased }
   
   Since a `String` has an underlying UTF-16 encoding, 
   certain operations are expensive, requiring iteration of 
   the characters of the string. In particular, [[size]]
   requires iteration of the whole string, and `get()`,
   `span()`, and `segment()` require iteration from the 
   beginning of the string to the given index."""
