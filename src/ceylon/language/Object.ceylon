"""The abstract supertype of all types representing definite 
   values. Any two `Object`s may be compared for value 
   equality using the `==` and `!=` operators:
   
       true==false
       1=="hello world"
       "hello"+" "+"world"=="hello world"
       Singleton("hello world")=={ "hello world" }
   
   However, since `Null` is not a subtype of `Object`, the
   value `null` cannot be compared to any other value using 
   the `==` operator. Thus, value equality is not defined 
   for optional types. This neatly bypasses the problem of
   deciding the value of the expression `null==null`, which 
   is simply illegal."""
