"A range of adjacent [[Enumerable]] values. Two values of an
 enumerable type are considered _adjacent_ if their 
 [[offset|Enumerable.offset]] is of unit or zero magnitude. 
 Thus, a `Range` is a list of values where for every integer 
 `index` where both `index` and `index+1` fall within the 
 indices of the range:
 
     range[index+1].offset(range[index]).magnitude <= 1
 
 A range is always nonempty, containing at least one value.
 Thus, it is a [[Sequence]].
 
 A sequence of adjacent values may be represented very 
 efficiently in memory, either:
 
 - via its endpoints, `first..last`, or 
 - via an endpoint and length, `first:size`.
 
 Furthermore, certain operations are much more efficient 
 than for other lists, assuming that the enumerable type has 
 efficient [[neighbour|Enumerable.neighbour]] and
 [[offset|Enumerable.offset]] functions.
 
 The functions [[ceylon.language::span]] and 
 [[ceylon.language::measure]], and corresponding operators 
 `..` and `:` are used to create new instances of `Range`."
