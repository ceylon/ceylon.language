"Abstraction of [[numeric|Numeric]] types with a natural 
 [[total order|Comparable]], including the built-in numeric 
 types [[Integer]] and [[Float]].
 
 A `Number` has a well-defined [[magnitude]] together with a 
 [[sign]] of type [[Integer]], defined for any instance `x`
 as follows:
 
 - if `x==0` then `x.sign==0` and `x.magnitude==0`,
 - if `x>0` then `x.sign==1` and `x.magnitude==x`, or
 - if `x<0` then `x.sign==-1` and `x.magnitude==-x`,
 
 where `0` is the additive identity of the numeric type.
 
 Not every value commonly considered to be a \"number\" is
 a `Number`. For example, complex numbers aren't `Number`s
 since they don't have a total order."
