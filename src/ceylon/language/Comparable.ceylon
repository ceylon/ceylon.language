"""The general contract for values whose magnitude can be 
   compared. `Comparable` imposes a total ordering upon
   instances of any type that satisfies the interface.
   
   If a type `T` satisfies `Comparable<T>`, then instances 
   of `T` may be compared using the comparison operators
   `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
   
       assert (x>=0.0);
   
   A _ternary comparison_ is useful for asserting lower and 
   upper bounds.
   
       assert (0.0<=x<1.0);
   
   Finally, the _compare_ operator `<=>` may be used to 
   produce an instance of [[Comparison]].
   
       switch (x<=>y)
       case (equal) {
           print("same same");
       }
       case (smaller) {
           print("x smaller");
       }
       case (larger) {
           print("y smaller");
       }
   
   The total order of a type must be consistent with the 
   definition of equality for the type. That is, there are 
   three mutually exclusive possibilities:
   
   - `x<y`,
   - `x>y`, or
   - `x==y`
   
   (These possibilities are expressed by the enumerated
   instances [[smaller]], [[larger]], and [[equal]] of
   `Comparison`.)"""
